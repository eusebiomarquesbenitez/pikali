Pentesting station for Rapsberry with TFT screen and Kali Linux

Initially, I thought this project as a fork from the amazing KALI-PI Launcher by Re4son (https://github.com/re4son/pitftmenu). But finally, I rebuilt it from zero, because I want to use it as a portable and autonomous pentesting device. So, I had to add new tools and a way to configure and use it in a different way.

The idea behind this project, it's to give you the possibility to perform a quick pentest "on the fly". Also, it could be use as part of a large pentesting process.

The project is far from be finished, but I think it's good to start any new idea or critics about it.
